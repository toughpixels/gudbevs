the winner (by a hair) because despite the general nastiness of coconut and pineapple seltzer flavors, this is more drinkable and lacks the frankly farty aftertaste that beleaguers most of the competition

Kï»¿larbrunn continues to have charming, Midwestern can designs that don't make you feel like you're on the spaceship in WallE, I think this could be reasonable if mixed with the precisely right ingredients, I probably will not buy it again though
