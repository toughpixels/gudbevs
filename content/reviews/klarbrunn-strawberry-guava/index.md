Iï»¿ can't say that I would be able to name the flavors that allegedly make up this combination (though the strawberry can def be discerned and I'm not sure that I trust my memory of what a stand-along guava tastes like) but the overall effect is pleasant as heck and sort of makes me think of some king of a wild Dole juice combination (which I loved because their presence meant I didn't have to choke down oragne juice, my mortal enemy) so this might be a nostalgia hit for me, the bubbles are delightful, blessings up to Klarbrunn
