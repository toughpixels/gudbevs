Wï»¿ow wow wow I was prepared for the worst but I love it, it tastes like sugarless cream soda which really works for me, thank you to jelly belly for the (1) the innumerable jelly beans I have consumed over the years and (2) teaching me that many of my fave childhood flavors hold up without sugar in adulthood
