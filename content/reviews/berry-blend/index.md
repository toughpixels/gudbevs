Lï»¿a Croix berry could never, this one has a slight medicinal tinge which is the only reason I'm not giving this a 10/10, great at room temp, great cold, the flavor is very much "all of the nice red berries" without the usual sneaky berry that manages to overwhelm the rest, klarbrunn continues to excel at bubbles
